- Potentially includes actions (save, share, download)

#### PaperFilter.tsx
- Provides advanced filtering capabilities
- Filter options include:
  - Date range
  - Research categories/topics
  - Author names
  - Keywords
- Real-time filter updates

#### PaperGrid.tsx
- Responsive grid layout for paper cards
- Handles pagination or infinite scroll
- Manages layout responsiveness
- Optimizes rendering for large datasets

### 2. Pages

## Component Interactions
- PaperFilter → ResearchPapers: Emits filter changes
- Search → ResearchPapers: Provides search results
- ResearchPapers → PaperGrid: Passes filtered/searched paper data
- PaperCard ↔ ResearchPapers: Handles paper selection and interactions

## Data Flow
1. User initiates search or applies filters
2. ResearchPapers component coordinates data fetching
3. Updated data flows to PaperGrid
4. Individual PaperCards render with new data

## Performance Considerations
- Pagination/infinite scroll for large datasets
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Optimized re-rendering strategies
- Caching of frequently accessed data
